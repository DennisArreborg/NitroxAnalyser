NitroxAnalyser
==============

Arduino project for a o2 analyser


So far this is a code in development running on a Esplora board using the light sensor as a dummy O2 fuel cell.
It will be transfered to an Ardoino micro.

O2 cell will be a Teledyn R17-van
I will use an ADS1115 16 bit ADC to monitor the output from the O2 cell.
I plan to also monitor:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Battery voltage
